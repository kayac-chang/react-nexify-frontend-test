### Command Line Interface

In a project where Vite is installed, you can use the vite binary in your npm scripts, or run it directly with npx vite. Here is the default npm scripts in a scaffolded Vite project:

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite", // start dev server
    "build": "vite build", // build for production
    "serve": "vite preview" // locally preview production build
  }
}
```
You can specify additional CLI options like --port or --https. For a full list of CLI options, run npx vite --help in your project.
